A card game inspired by Magic: The Gathering and Gwent, developed for an Encode Club Web3 code jam during a period of 4 weekends (as I was working full-time during this project).

Our idea was to create a green blockchain project, backed by Polkadot's cutting-edge technology and low energy consumption.

Our team planted over 300 trees, which were subsequently transformed into NFTs representing ownership (landowner contract, GPS coordinates, etc.) and in-game cards.  


The objective of this game is to reduce the opponent's hit points to 0.
Each player has 2 rows for cards: one for growth cards (that grant mana) and another for creature cards (that can attack).
Each card has its own unique effects.
